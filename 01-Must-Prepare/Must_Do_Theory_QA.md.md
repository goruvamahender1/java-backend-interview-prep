18 Key Design Patterns Every Developer Should Know

Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems, resulting in a smoother, more efficient development process. They serve as blueprints for building better software structures. These are some of the most popular patterns:

- Abstract Factory: Family Creator - Makes groups of related items.
- Builder: Lego Master - Builds objects step by step, keeping creation and appearance
- Prototype: Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples.
- Singleton: One and Only - A special class with just one instance.
- Adapter: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.
- Bridge: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.
- Composite: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.
- Decorator: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.
- Facade: One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface.
- Flyweight: Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently.
- Proxy: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.
- Chain of Responsibility: Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled.
- Command: Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action.
- Iterator: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.
- Mediator: Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes.
- Memento: Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state.
- Observer: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.

Spring Boot Annotations You Must Know to Level Up Your Spring Boot Skills 👇

Let's dive into the key Spring Boot annotations every developer should know to build powerful, efficient applications. Here's your cheat sheet:

📌 @SpringBootApplication: Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan to configure and initialize the Spring application context automatically.

📌 @EnableAutoConfiguration: Automatically configures the Spring app based on the classpath, available beans, and other configurations.

📌 @SpringBootConfiguration: Declares that a class contains Spring Boot-specific configurations.

📌 @ComponentScan: Directs Spring to scan specific packages for components, configurations, and services.

📌 @RestController & @Controller: Used to handle web requests by mapping them to their corresponding handler methods.

📌 @ResponseBody: Directs that the return type should be written straight to the HTTP response body, typically in REST APIs.

📌 @PathVariable & @RequestParam: Maps method parameters to URL variables and request parameters, respectively, allowing dynamic handling of requests.

📌 @Component, @Service, @Repository: Mark classes as Spring-managed components for dependency injection.

📌 @Autowired: Automatically injects dependencies into constructors, fields, setters, or methods.

📌 @Qualifier: Resolves conflicts when multiple beans of the same type are present by specifying which one to inject.

📌 @Primary: Marks a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple options are available.

📌 @Bean: Defines a method that returns a Spring-managed bean.

📌 @ConfigurationProperties: Binds external configurations (like properties files) to a configuration object.

📌 @Conditional: Conditionally includes or excludes configuration parts based on specific conditions.

📌 @Scheduled: Triggers a method to run at predefined intervals for scheduled tasks.

📌 @Value: Injects values from external sources into configuration parameters.

📌 @PropertySource: Adds properties from external sources to Spring's environment.

📌 @Profile: Activates components only when specific application profiles (like "dev" or "prod") are active.

📌 Testing Annotations:

@SpringBootTest: Used for running Spring Boot integration tests.
@DataJpaTest: Tests JPA repositories.
@WebMvcTest: Focuses on testing the web layer.

Mastering these Spring Boot annotations will make your development process smoother, faster, and more efficient. Know any other must-use annotations? Share your thoughts below!

Everything Spring Boot Developers Should Know About Feature‑Based Architecture 👇

Organizing your Spring Boot projects by feature makes them easier to manage and grow. But how does this approach work? 

Let’s break it down ⬇️


[1.] Feature‑Centric Packages
◾ Group related code under feature names (e.g., `user`, `config`, `common`).
◾ Enforce module boundaries for clearer ownership and easier navigation.

[2.] Separation of Concerns
◾Service – Encapsulates business logic.
◾ Repository – Handles data persistence.
◾ DTO – Defines data transfer shapes.
◾ Entity – Maps to database tables.
◾ Controller – Exposes REST endpoints.

[3.] Shared Infrastructure
◾ Global Configs – Centralizes application properties.
◾ Exception Handling – Standardizes error responses.
◾ Utilities – Houses reusable helpers and validators.

[4.] Environment‑Specific Setup
◾ Dev vs. Prod Profiles – Activates the correct settings for each environment.
◾ Docker Support – Builds container images with JIB and Dockerfiles.
◾ Local Development – Orchestrates services via `docker‑compose.yml`.

[5.] Maven‑Standard Structure
◾ Follows `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources` conventions.
◾ Aligns with Spring Boot best practices for immediate familiarity.


💡 Why This Matters
◾ Readability – Locate code by feature, not by layer.
◾ Scalability – Add features without bloating core packages.
◾ Maintainability – Isolate changes to specific modules.
◾ Onboarding – New team members ramp up faster when the structure is predictable.

🔍 Interview Questions - ✅ Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.

All of these are Spring stereotypes used to create beans and manage them with Spring’s container. But we use them for different purposes to make the code clean and meaningful.

🔧 How I used them in my project:

✅ @Component – I used this for normal classes like utility or helper classes.
 For example: I had a class for date conversions — just logic, no DB or business logic — so I used @Component.

✅ @Service – For business logic.
 Like in UserService, I wrote all my login, registration, and user operations. I used @Service to tell Spring — this class handles business tasks.

✅ @Repository – For database operations.
 I used this on interfaces that extended JpaRepository, like UserRepository.
 Bonus: It also helped convert database exceptions to Spring-friendly ones automatically.

✅ @Controller – For handling web/API requests.
 At first, I used this to create web pages using Thymeleaf. Later I used 

✅ @RestController when building REST APIs to send JSON responses.

🚀 Serialization & Deserialization in Java 💻☕

🔐 Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a byte stream 🧱 — making it easy to save the object to a file 🗂️ or send it over a network 🌐.

🔓 Deserialization is the reverse process — converting the byte stream back into a Java object 🧬.

📦 Why use it?
✅ Store object state persistently (e.g., in files or DBs)
✅ Transmit objects between JVMs or over networks (e.g., RMI, HTTP)

🛠️ How to serialize in Java?

ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.ser"));
oos.writeObject(myObject);
oos.close();

🛠️ How to deserialize in Java?

ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.ser"));
MyClass obj = (MyClass) ois.readObject();
ois.close();

🧾 Note:
 • The class must implement Serializable 🧩
 • Fields marked transient ❌ will not be serialized

💡 Use serialization wisely — it’s powerful, but version control of classes and performance considerations are important! ⚠️



JPA vs Hibernate: Key Differences Every Java Developer Should Know 🚀

🔷 Java Persistence API (JPA)
1️⃣ JPA is a specification for managing relational data in Java apps.
2️⃣ Comes under jakarta.persistence package.
3️⃣ Provides standard APIs for ORM but doesn’t include actual implementation.
4️⃣ Uses EntityManagerFactory to interact with the persistence unit.
5️⃣ Uses EntityManager to perform CRUD operations & manage entities.
6️⃣ Uses JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) for querying entities.

🔶 Hibernate
1️⃣ Hibernate is a framework (ORM tool) that implements JPA specification.
2️⃣ Comes under org.hibernate package.
3️⃣ Provides the implementation of JPA and adds extra features.
4️⃣ Uses SessionFactory to create Session instances.
5️⃣ Uses Session for CRUD operations – bridges the app and DB.
6️⃣ Uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language) for querying entities.


✅ Scenario-Based Spring Boot FAQ 

🔒 Scenario 1: Securing REST APIs

Q: Your Spring Boot REST API must support both public and secured endpoints. How would you implement this?
 A:
Use Spring Security.
Public URLs in WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (or SecurityFilterChain in Spring Security 5.7+):
java

http
 .authorizeHttpRequests()
 .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
 .anyRequest().authenticated();

Use JWT/OAuth2 for token-based authentication.
Add method-level security with @PreAuthorize.



🧵 Scenario 2: Long-Running Requests / Async Processing

Q: A user triggers a long-running operation (e.g., report generation). How would you ensure a non-blocking experience?
 A:
Use @Async with @EnableAsync.
Return a CompletableFuture<> or use messaging queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
Notify user via WebSocket, polling, or email.


💾 Scenario 3: Connecting to Multiple Databases

Q: Your application needs to connect to two different databases. How would you configure it?


🔍 Java Stream – Finding the Smallest Number

Problem Statement:
“I want to get the smallest number in a list using the Stream API.”
Simple?
🧠 Constraint: Must use Stream API

💡 Solution:
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(4, 1, 8, 2, 5, 19, 3);

private static int getMinUsingStream(List<Integer> numbers) {
 return numbers.stream()
 .reduce(Integer.MAX_VALUE, (x, y) -> x > y ? y : x);
}
Curious minds: How would you solve this differently using streams?

💻 Java Developer Interview Experience – Spring Boot CRUD
I recently attended an interview for a Java Full Stack Developer role, where the first task was to write CRUD operations for an Employee entity using Spring Boot.
After completing the CRUD implementation, the interviewer asked me a series of real-time scenario-based questions related to the code I had written:
1️⃣ What architecture are you using in your Spring Boot application?
2️⃣ What improvements can be made to the basic CRUD operations?
3️⃣ What are the core rules and best practices of REST API design?
4️⃣ When a new record is added to the database, how is it retrieved? Will the cache reflect the new data?
5️⃣ If the Department is part of another microservice, how would you access its data?
6️⃣ If the Employee entity has 20–25 fields, how do you handle partial updates during the update operation? How do you prevent overwriting existing values with null?

Spring Boot – Powerful, But Not Always Perfect

👋 In a recent interview , I was asked a question that caught me off guard:

“What are the disadvantages of using Spring Boot?”

Like many of us, I was so used to discussing its strengths — rapid development, auto-config, starter modules — that I hadn’t deeply reflected on its trade-offs.
I took some time to think, and here’s what I came up with 👇

🔍 Disadvantages of Spring Boot (Worth Considering):
⚙️ Auto-Configuration is a Black Box :: 
While convenient, it hides internal behaviors — harder to debug or customize deeply.
🐘 Higher Memory & Startup Time ::
 Not ideal for low-memory or fast-boot scenarios (like serverless).
📦 Fat JAR Size ::
 Spring Boot apps tend to package all dependencies, leading to large artifacts (~50–100MB+).
🧰 Overkill for Simple Tools ::
 For lightweight tasks or utilities, it may add unnecessary complexity.
🧩 Tuning Can Be Tricky ::
 Multiple abstraction layers make performance tuning and profiling less straightforward.
🔗 Tight Coupling with Spring Ecosystem ::
 Once you adopt Spring Boot, switching away isn’t easy.
📚 Advanced Customization Requires Deep Knowledge ::
 Disabling or altering default behaviors (like auto-config) demands in-depth Spring experience.

✅ Spring Boot is fantastic for enterprise applications, but it’s not one-size-fits-all.
 🎯 Being aware of its trade-offs helps us make better architectural decisions — especially as Technical Leads or Architects.

🚀 Technical Interview Prep: Core Java, Spring Boot & Microservices Essentials 🚀
As I gear up for upcoming interviews, here are some key concepts and questions I’m revising — thought it might help fellow developers preparing for similar roles!
💻 Round 1 – Core Java & Spring Boot
1️⃣ What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
2️⃣ HashMap vs TreeMap — when to use which?
HashMap is unordered and faster (O(1) average), TreeMap is sorted by key and slower (O(log n)).
3️⃣ Difference between == and .equals()
== compares references, .equals() compares object content.
4️⃣ Thread creation: extends Thread vs implements Runnable
Runnable preferred for flexibility and allowing inheritance from other classes.
5️⃣ Why public static void main(String[] args)?
Entry point of a Java app; static allows JVM to call without object.
6️⃣ Is multithreading recommended in production? Why?
Yes, for better resource utilization but must handle concurrency carefully.
7️⃣ How to use Streams API for collection transformation?
Use functional operations like map, filter, reduce for concise code.
8️⃣ Benefits of Lambda expressions
Simplifies code, enables functional programming, reduces boilerplate.
9️⃣ Spring Framework vs Spring Boot
Spring Boot simplifies Spring with auto-configuration and embedded servers.
🔟 Role of @ComponentScan and @Configuration annotations
Scans for components and marks config classes for Spring beans.
1️⃣1️⃣ What’s inside @SpringBootApplication?
Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
1️⃣2️⃣ Advantages of Spring Boot
Faster setup, less config, embedded server, starter dependencies.
1️⃣3️⃣ Why use @RestController in REST APIs?
Simplifies controllers by combining @Controller and @ResponseBody.
🔥 Round 2 – Advanced Java, Design & Microservices
1️⃣ PUT vs POST — interchangeable or not?
PUT is idempotent (update/replace), POST is for creating resources.
2️⃣ DELETE vs TRUNCATE — what’s the difference?
DELETE removes rows one by one (can rollback), TRUNCATE deletes all fast (can’t rollback).
3️⃣ Why avoid public static final for Singleton?
Singleton needs controlled lazy instantiation, not just static constants.
4️⃣ What happens if you swap @Service and @Repository?
Exception translation may break because @Repository handles persistence exceptions.
5️⃣ HTTP 403 vs 404 — what do they mean?
403: Access forbidden, 404: Resource not found.
6️⃣ How does HashMap work internally?
Uses hashcodes to place entries into buckets; handles collisions via linked lists or balanced trees.
7️⃣ Overview of JVM Architecture
Includes Class Loader, Runtime Data Areas, Execution Engine, Garbage Collector.
8️⃣ Role of @SpringBootActuator in monitoring apps
Provides metrics, health checks, and app info for production readiness.


🧠 Let’s Discuss: Java Interview Deep Dive — Method Overriding Concepts
Are these questions really important for interviews? 🤔 Let’s discuss in the comments 👇
❓ Can we override a method that throws a checked exception with one that doesn't?
 ✅ Yes, the child class can throw fewer or no checked exceptions.
❓ What happens if the method in child class has a different return type?
 ✅ It’s allowed if the return type is covariant — i.e., a subclass of the parent return type.
❓ What if I override equals() and not hashCode()?
 ⚠️ That breaks the contract — especially dangerous when using objects in HashMap, HashSet, etc.
❓ What happens if we forget to use @Override annotation?
 ⚠️ Code will compile, but you might silently write the wrong method — very risky.
❓ How does JVM decide which method to call when overriding is involved?
 🎯 Runtime polymorphism — based on the actual object, not the reference type.

✅ 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 – 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮?
This is one of the most commonly asked Core Java questions.
 And I used to get confused by it during my early preparation.
 But here’s a simple and strong explanation 👇

❓ 𝗤: Why is String immutable in Java?
🔹 In Java, when we say a String is immutable, it means once it is created, it cannot be changed.
 If you try to change it, Java will actually create a new object, not modify the original one.

🧠 But why did Java make String immutable?
✅ 1. Security:
 String is used in sensitive areas like file paths, database URLs, and network connections.
 If it could be changed, hackers might easily break things.

✅ 2. Memory Efficiency (String Pool):
 Java stores strings in a special memory area called the String pool.
 Since strings don’t change, Java can reuse them to save memory.

✅ 3. Thread Safety:
 Multiple threads can use the same string without problems, because it can’t change.

💡 Simple Example:
String name = "Sudip";
name.concat(" Paladhi");
System.out.println(name); // Still prints: Sudip

👉 Even after using concat(), the original name is not changed.

📌 This type of question checks your core understanding, not just syntax.

💬 Let’s discuss in comments:
 Did you ever get confused by Java strings?



 Rare Java + Spring Boot + Microservices Questions , with Clear understanding Answers.

1. What moves a thread from Runnable to Running? What does Thread.yield() do?
 Ans: When a thread is in the Runnable state, it means it’s ready to run but waiting for the CPU.
 The CPU scheduler (part of the Operating System) decides when it should move to Running. The JVM doesn’t control when exactly it runs.
Thread.yield() tells the thread scheduler, “I’m willing to let other threads run first.” But it’s just a suggestion ,the thread might continue running if no other thread is ready.
Example:
 Suppose you have multiple background tasks running. You can call yield() to let another thread finish first, especially in multitasking environments.

2. Why did Java 8 introduce default and static methods in interfaces?
Ans: Before Java 8, interfaces could only have method declarations — no method bodies.
 Java 8 introduced default and static methods to allow interfaces to evolve without breaking old code.
This helped:
Add new features (like forEach() in Iterable) without changing every implementation.
Provide common reusable logic in interfaces.
Use Case Example:
 If you have an interface Vehicle, you can add a default void start() method — existing classes like Car or Bike don’t need to change to get this behavior. 

3. SynchronizedMap vs ConcurrentHashMap — Which is better in multi-threaded apps?
Ans: SynchronizedMap locks the entire map during any operation. It is simple but slow in multi-threaded apps.
ConcurrentHashMap divides the map into segments and locks only the part being used. This makes it much faster in concurrent environments.
Use Case Example:
 If multiple threads update and read from a shared cache or map, use ConcurrentHashMap for better performance and safety. 

4. What is the Decomposition Pattern in Microservices?
Ans: It is a method of breaking down a large monolithic application into smaller, independent microservices.
 Each service handles a specific business function, such as Orders, Payments, or Notifications.
Common strategies:
Decomposition by Business Capability
Decomposition by Subdomain (from Domain-Driven Design
Use Case Example:
 In an e-commerce app, splitting the system into services like ProductService, CartService, PaymentService helps develop, deploy, and scale them independently.

5. How do you monitor logs in Spring Boot applications?
Ans: Spring Boot provides built-in support using Spring Boot Actuator to expose metrics and health endpoints.
 For centralized logging and monitoring:
Use tools like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Or Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting.
Use Case Example:
 In production, instead of checking logs on each server, logs are sent to Elasticsearch and visualized in Kibana. This helps in tracking errors, request flows, and app performance from one place.



 🔍One of the Most Common API Performance Questions in Interviews!

"Your API is slow in fetching data -what would you do?"

As a backend engineer, this question tests your optimization skills. Here are some key strategies senior Java developers rely on:

✅ Rate Limiting & Throttling– Control API request rates to prevent excessive load and ensure stability
✅ Load Balancing– Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and improve response times
✅ JPQL instead of `findById()`– Fetch only required fields, avoid unnecessary entity loading. 
✅ Pagination & Filtering– Never return thousands of records at once. Use `LIMIT & OFFSET`. 
✅ Asynchronous Processing– Offload heavy computations with `CompletableFuture`, WebFlux, or Kafka. 
✅ Smart Caching– Use Redis for frequently accessed data. 
✅ DTOs & Compression– Limit response size with DTOs & enable gzip compression.

💭 Spring vs Spring Boot — Clearing Up the Confusion!
While working on backend development with Java, I used to wonder — what's the real difference between Spring and Spring Boot? 🤔

After getting hands-on experience with both, here’s how I see it:

🧰 Spring Framework
 It’s the core framework that gives you a lot of flexibility. But with that comes a lot of setup — configuring dependencies, defining beans, setting up servers, and more. It’s powerful, but requires more effort to get things up and running.

⚡ Spring Boot
 This is built on top of Spring, but it simplifies things a lot. With features like auto-configuration, an embedded server, and sensible defaults, it lets you focus more on building the application rather than setting it up.

In short:
 ➡️ Spring = Gives you control
 ➡️ Spring Boot = Gets you started faster

If you're new to backend dev or building microservices, Spring Boot is a great starting point!


Most Java devs fail this part of the interview.

Not because they don’t know Spring Boot.

But because they can’t explain how they handle exceptions in a clean, structured way.

Here’s a simple way to talk about it — and stand out instantly 👇

1. Centralized handling

Don’t repeat exception logic in every controller.
Set up a global handler that catches and formats all exceptions in one place.

This makes your code cleaner — and much easier to debug or change later.

2. Use custom exceptions

Anyone can throw a generic error.
But custom exceptions show that you’re designing your app for clarity.

In one of my early projects, switching to named exceptions helped us trace bugs 10x faster during integration testing.


3. Structured error response

Think like the frontend dev.

Instead of sending raw errors, send a consistent structure:
timestamp, message, status code, and endpoint path.

Makes debugging faster and logs more readable.

You don’t have to over-engineer it.
But you do need a system that works — and you need to be able to explain it clearly.


One of the toughest Spring Boot interview questions isn’t even that complex.

It’s this:

“What is AutoConfiguration and how does it actually work?”

Most devs give a generic answer.
But here's the explanation that actually shows you’ve used it — not just studied it 👇

Spring Boot’s magic comes from AutoConfiguration.

But here’s what makes it tick:

1. It checks if certain classes (like Tomcat, Jackson) are on the classpath.

2. If yes, it auto-registers beans — unless you’ve defined your own.

3. All of this is enabled via `@EnableAutoConfiguration` behind the scenes.


4. The decision-making is based on `@Conditional` annotations.

Bonus tip:

> You can inspect this in action by enabling `debug=true` in `application.properties`.

> It shows exactly which AutoConfigurations are being applied or skipped.

This one setting helped me debug a broken DataSource config that looked fine — but was silently skipped.

Interview tip:

> When they ask “What is AutoConfiguration?”

> Say: “It’s conditional config activated by classpath + context — and it’s fully overrideable.”

That one sentence shows control, not just theory.



🚀 Java 8 – Simplifying HashMap Iteration Like a Pro!
Hey hashtag#JavaDevelopers 👋
If you’re still iterating over HashMap the old-school way, it’s time to embrace the power of Java 8! 💡
Here are different ways to iterate a HashMap and print the values using Java 8 features like forEach, lambda expressions, and streams. 👇

📌 1. Using forEach with Lambda
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("A", "Apple");
map.put("B", "Ball");
map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + " -> " + value));

📌 2. Using entrySet() and Stream API
map.entrySet().stream()
 .forEach(entry -> System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " -> " + entry.getValue()));

📌 3. Using keySet() and Stream
map.keySet().stream()
 .forEach(key -> System.out.println(key + " -> " + map.get(key)));

📌 4. Using values() and forEach
 (If you only need to print the values)
map.values().forEach(System.out::println);

📌 5. Using entrySet() and method reference
map.entrySet().forEach(System.out::println); // Prints key=value

➡️ These concise and readable approaches not only save lines of code but also make your logic cleaner and more functional.
Let’s continue to write cleaner Java by leveraging Java 8 features! ✨

🔍 Spring Data JPA – JpaRepository vs CrudRepository: When to Use What?

When working with Spring Boot, you often need to interact with the database. Choosing the right repository interface is key to cleaner and more powerful code.

✅ Use CrudRepository when:
 • You only need basic CRUD operations like save(), findById(), delete(), findAll()
 • Your application is simple or small-scale

✅ Use JpaRepository when:
 • You need advanced features like:
 • PagingAndSortingRepository support
 • Pagination (findAll(Pageable p))
 • Batch operations
 • flush(), saveAndFlush(), deleteInBatch(), etc.
 • You’re building complex applications with large datasets

🤔 Confused? You’re not alone.
Many beginners think a Spring Boot project can have only one @SpringBootApplication class — but that’s not entirely true!

📌 Answer:
Yes, you can have multiple @SpringBootApplication classes — especially in modular applications or when writing tests — but only one should be used to bootstrap the application.

💡 Example Use Case
Imagine you’re building an app with separate modules for UserService and AdminService. Each module can have its own main() class for testing or running separately.

// src/main/java/com/example/user/UserApplication.java
@SpringBootApplication
public class UserApplication {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 SpringApplication.run(UserApplication.class, args);
 }
}

// src/main/java/com/example/admin/AdminApplication.java
@SpringBootApplication
public class AdminApplication {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 SpringApplication.run(AdminApplication.class, args);
 }
}

🔄 Important Note: When deploying or building the final app, make sure only one of these classes is used to start the application, or you may run into conflicts

👨‍💻 Java Trivia Time!
 Let’s see how well you know your Java internals. Ready? 😄
🔍 Consider this snippet:

Integer a = 128;
Integer b = 128;
System.out.println(a == b);

🤔 What do you think this prints?
💭 Hint: It might not be what you expect.

Okay, now try this one:

Integer a = 127;
Integer b = 127;
System.out.println(a == b);

What’s the output this time?
💡 Answer and Explanation:
-First prints: false
-Second prints: true
Why? Because of something called Integer Caching in Java!

✅ Java caches Integer objects in the range of -128 to 127.
 When you assign an Integer within this range, Java doesn't create a new object — it reuses an existing one.
So:

Integer a = 127;
Integer b = 127;
a == b // true 
But:

Integer a = 128;
Integer b = 128;
a == b // false 

This behaviour of Java is called Integer Caching.

🧠 Moral of the story: Use .equals() to compare values, not ==, unless you really know what’s happening under the hood.

You can even tweak the caching range using:
-XX:AutoBoxCacheMax=<your_value>

Java is full of little performance tricks — and surprises! ⚡
 Have you ever run into this in production or interviews?

 🚀 Tricky Interview Questions Series on Core Java, Spring Boot, Microservices🌟

✅ Q.How do you handle Microservices communication failure in production?

Handling communication failure between microservices in production is critical to ensuring system reliability and user experience. Several strategies and tools are implemented to detect, isolate, and recover from failures in a robust way:

1. ✅ Retry Mechanism
Introduce a controlled retry mechanism with exponential backoff. This allows temporary issues (like network latency or service restarts) to recover without user impact. Tools like Resilience4j or Spring Retry are commonly used. Retries must be capped to avoid overloading the downstream service.

2. ⚡ Circuit Breaker Pattern
A circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to a failing service after a defined threshold. When the circuit is open, fallback logic is executed. Tools like Resilience4j or Netflix Hystrix (legacy) help implement this effectively.

3. 🧰 Fallback Methods
Provide default responses when a service is unavailable. This ensures user experience is not severely impacted. For example, cached data or static responses can be returned instead of complete failures.

4. ⏱️ Timeout Settings
Define strict timeouts on service-to-service calls. This avoids indefinite waiting and helps release system resources like threads and connections quickly.

5. 🧱 Bulkhead Pattern
Isolate services into separate thread pools or resources to prevent a failure in one service from exhausting system resources. This ensures other services continue to function.

6. 🔄 Asynchronous Communication
Use message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ for loosely coupled, fault-tolerant communication. This allows the producer to proceed even if the consumer is temporarily unavailable.

7. 📈 Centralized Monitoring & Alerting
Monitor key metrics such as latency, error rate, request volume, and circuit state using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or Zipkin. Set up alerts for early detection and remediation.

8. 🎛️ Graceful Degradation
Design your services to degrade gracefully under failure. Disable non-critical features or provide limited functionality rather than failing completely.

9. ❤️ Health Checks & Service Discovery
Use regular health checks to deregister unhealthy instances from service registries like Eureka or Consul. This ensures only healthy services receive traffic.

10. 🌐 Failover & Redundancy
Deploy services across multiple zones or instances. Use load balancers or service meshes (e.g., Istio) to reroute traffic during service failures.


🔐 Authentication vs Authorization in Spring Security

Know the difference 👇

✅ Authentication = Who are you?

Verifies identity

Uses username/password, JWT, OAuth

Filter: UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter


✅ Authorization = What can you access?

Checks permissions/roles

Uses @PreAuthorize, @Secured

Controls access to endpoints/resources


🧠 Remember:

Authentication → Entry gate 🚪

Authorization → Access control 🎯


🚀 Technical Interview Prep: Core Java, Spring Boot & Microservices Essentials 🚀
As I gear up for upcoming interviews, here are some key concepts and questions I’m revising — thought it might help fellow developers preparing for similar roles!
💻 Round 1 – Core Java & Spring Boot
1️⃣ What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
2️⃣ HashMap vs TreeMap — when to use which?
HashMap is unordered and faster (O(1) average), TreeMap is sorted by key and slower (O(log n)).
3️⃣ Difference between == and .equals()
== compares references, .equals() compares object content.
4️⃣ Thread creation: extends Thread vs implements Runnable
Runnable preferred for flexibility and allowing inheritance from other classes.
5️⃣ Why public static void main(String[] args)?
Entry point of a Java app; static allows JVM to call without object.
6️⃣ Is multithreading recommended in production? Why?
Yes, for better resource utilization but must handle concurrency carefully.
7️⃣ How to use Streams API for collection transformation?
Use functional operations like map, filter, reduce for concise code.
8️⃣ Benefits of Lambda expressions
Simplifies code, enables functional programming, reduces boilerplate.
9️⃣ Spring Framework vs Spring Boot
Spring Boot simplifies Spring with auto-configuration and embedded servers.
🔟 Role of @ComponentScan and @Configuration annotations
Scans for components and marks config classes for Spring beans.
1️⃣1️⃣ What’s inside @SpringBootApplication?
Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
1️⃣2️⃣ Advantages of Spring Boot
Faster setup, less config, embedded server, starter dependencies.
1️⃣3️⃣ Why use @RestController in REST APIs?
Simplifies controllers by combining @Controller and @ResponseBody.
🔥 Round 2 – Advanced Java, Design & Microservices
1️⃣ PUT vs POST — interchangeable or not?
PUT is idempotent (update/replace), POST is for creating resources.
2️⃣ DELETE vs TRUNCATE — what’s the difference?
DELETE removes rows one by one (can rollback), TRUNCATE deletes all fast (can’t rollback).
3️⃣ Why avoid public static final for Singleton?
Singleton needs controlled lazy instantiation, not just static constants.
4️⃣ What happens if you swap @Service and @Repository?
Exception translation may break because @Repository handles persistence exceptions.
5️⃣ HTTP 403 vs 404 — what do they mean?
403: Access forbidden, 404: Resource not found.
6️⃣ How does HashMap work internally?
Uses hashcodes to place entries into buckets; handles collisions via linked lists or balanced trees.
7️⃣ Overview of JVM Architecture
Includes Class Loader, Runtime Data Areas, Execution Engine, Garbage Collector.
8️⃣ Role of @SpringBootActuator in monitoring apps
Provides metrics, health checks, and app info for production readiness.


Most Spring Boot answers sound like Google results.

But here’s how I explain this in interviews
and it sticks every time:

“What’s the difference between Filters and Interceptors?”

Save this. This is the breakdown that separates surface-level prep from actual backend confidence 👇

Filters:

* Part of the Servlet API (javax.servlet)
* Run before the request hits Spring context
* Great for cross-cutting concerns: logging, CORS, authentication
* Example: Logging IP address or validating headers before Spring even sees it

Real use:

> I created a custom `OncePerRequestFilter` to block all requests missing a required header. Saved us from an entire class of errors.

Interceptors:

* Part of Spring MVC (`HandlerInterceptor`)
* Run after the request enters Spring context
* Great for user tracking, auth checks, timing, modifying responses
* Runs in 3 phases: `preHandle`, `postHandle`, `afterCompletion`

Real use:

> I used `preHandle()` to check session auth, and `afterCompletion()` to log execution time for every controller helped us detect slow endpoints.

Quick Difference

* Filters are servlet-level → run before DispatcherServlet
* Interceptors are Spring-level → run before/after controller

I got this question 3 times in the last 6 months.
Most devs struggle with it.
You won’t anymore.


💡 Java Interview Preparation: What's the difference between wait() and sleep()?

Whether you're working with threads or preparing for your next Java interview, this is a classic question that tests your understanding of concurrency.

👇 Here's the key difference:

🔹 wait()
Belongs to Object class
Must be called from a synchronized block/method
Releases the lock on the object
Used for inter-thread communication

🔹 sleep()
Belongs to Thread class
Can be called from anywhere
Does NOT release the lock
Used to pause the current thread for a specified time

📌 Both throw InterruptedException, but they serve very different purposes.

🧠 Pro Tip:
 Use wait() when threads need to coordinate with each other (e.g., producer-consumer pattern).

 Use sleep() when you simply want a thread to pause temporarily.

Keep sharpening your Java fundamentals. They often make the biggest impact in interviews and real-world system design!


I attended an interview for the position of Java Full Stack Developer. The entire interview was conducted using pen and paper, which tested my ability to write clean and efficient code without the help of an IDE. The session began with a series of coding problems, including reversing a string (my name), counting the occurrences of each character, checking whether a given year is a leap year (with a condition to throw a custom exception if the input was not 4 digits), and sorting a custom User class using Comparable, Comparator, and Java Streams. This was followed by theoretical questions that covered core Java, OOP concepts, backend security, and frontend development using React.
