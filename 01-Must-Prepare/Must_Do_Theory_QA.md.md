#### 1. What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) : One of most frequently asked question in interview

Let's undertsand this

1. 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The user provides credentials to the server (e.g., username and password). The server checks these credentials against a database or authentication service. If valid, the process continues to the next step.

2. 𝐉𝐖𝐓 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞: The server generates a JWT that contains user data in its payload. The JWT includes a header, payload, and signature for security. The server sends the token back to the client.

3. 𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐔𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞: The client stores the JWT securely (in local storage or cookies). For future requests to protected resources, the client includes the JWT in the "Authorization" header. This signals the server to validate the request.

4. 𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Upon receiving the JWT, the server checks its signature using a secret key. The server also verifies expiration time, audience, and other claims. If everything is valid, the server grants access.

5. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐑𝐞𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐡: JWTs store all necessary user data within the token, so no session data is stored on the server. If the JWT expires, the client can use a refresh token to get a new JWT without reauthentication.

#### 15. What is Oauth 2.0?
Oauth 2.0 Explained With Simple Terms. 

OAuth 2.0 is a powerful and secure framework that allows different applications to securely interact with each other on behalf of users without sharing sensitive credentials. 
 
The entities involved in OAuth are the User, the Server, and the Identity Provider (IDP). 
 
What Can an OAuth Token Do? 
 
When you use OAuth, you get an OAuth token that represents your identity and permissions. This token can do a few important things: 
 
Single Sign-On (SSO): With an OAuth token, you can log into multiple services or apps using just one login, making life easier and safer. 
 
Authorization Across Systems: The OAuth token allows you to share your authorization or access rights across various systems, so you don't have to log in separately everywhere. 
 
Accessing User Profile: Apps with an OAuth token can access certain parts of your user profile that you allow, but they won't see everything. 
 
Remember, OAuth 2.0 is all about keeping you and your data safe while making your online experiences seamless and hassle-free across different applications and services.

#### 50. What is CORS? Why Does It Happen? ? The Real Problem Behind CORS ? How Do You Fix It? Can We Bypass CORS? 
What is CORS? 
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing—a security feature built into browsers. 

It blocks requests made from one origin (domain, protocol, or port) to another origin unless explicitly allowed by the server. 

For example: 
- Your frontend is hosted at `frontend.com`. 
- Your backend API is hosted at `api.backend.com`. 

The browser treats these as different origins and blocks the request unless it’s explicitly allowed. 

 2/ Why Does It Happen? 
CORS errors are triggered by the Same-Origin Policy, which prevents malicious websites from making unauthorized API calls using your credentials. 

When the backend server doesn’t include the right CORS headers, the browser refuses to share the response and throws this error: 

> *Access to fetch at 'https://api.backend.com' from origin 'https://frontend.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present.* 

In short, the browser isn’t blocking the request—it’s blocking the response for security reasons. 

 3/ The Real Problem Behind CORS 
- It’s not a frontend issue. 
- It’s not a browser bug. 
- It’s a server-side configuration issue. 

Most candidates panic and assume the browser is the problem. It’s not. 

CORS is the server’s responsibility to allow or deny requests from other origins. 

 4/ How Do You Fix It? 

Step 1: Update the Backend. 
The server must send the right headers, like: 
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (Allows all origins). 
- Or specify trusted domains like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.com`. 

Step 2: Handle Preflight Requests (OPTIONS). 
For complex requests (like `POST` with custom headers), browsers send a preflight request before the actual call. 

The server must respond to this with: 
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS` 
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization` 

Step 3: Use a Proxy for Local Development. 
If the backend isn’t updated yet, set up a proxy to forward requests through the same origin as your frontend. 

 5/ Can We Bypass CORS? 
Short answer—No. 

Any hacky workaround, like disabling CORS in the browser or using extensions, won’t work in production. 

Fix it properly by configuring the server. That’s the only scalable solution. 

 6/ Why Is This Important in Interviews? 
Because CORS tests whether you: 
- Understand how the web works. 
- Can debug issues logically. 
- Know where the real problem lies (backend vs frontend).
